I created an application that suggests users meals when the user inputs the time of day i added a textView to write the name of my application which is called munch mate .I added a editText where the user will be able to write the time of day then the meal option will be displayed where i added a textView widget there will be differnt meal option at different times of the day .Theres also a button named munch time this is the button that the user will click in order to get the meal or snacks .theres a button called the reset button this will erase everything on my display option as well as what the user has added.I also have an exit button which allows the user to exit the app at any given time theres also a code that covers for invalid inputs instead of the app crashing
